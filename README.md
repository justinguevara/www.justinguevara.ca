## www<span></span>.justinguevara.ca - frontend

This repository contains source code and configuration for the frontend app hosted at www.justinguevara.ca. For this website, I build anything I feel like building.

The frontend app is a typical React project, involving technologies such as Vite, TypeScript etc. and is intended to be/is actually hosted on an object/storage service like Amazon S3.
